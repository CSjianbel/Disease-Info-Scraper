As a result, blood pressure increases in the lungs. This condition is called pulmonary hypertension.\n\n\n\n\n Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart. In one form of pulmonary hypertension, called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), blood vessels in the lungs are narrowed, blocked or destroyed. The damage slows blood flow through the lungs. Blood pressure in the lung arteries goes up. The heart must work harder to pump blood through the lungs. The extra effort eventually causes the heart muscle to become weak and fail. In some people, pulmonary hypertension slowly gets worse and can be life-threatening. There's no cure for pulmonary hypertension.

Even when pulmonary hypertension is more advanced, its symptoms are similar to those of other heart and lung conditions.\nTo diagnose pulmonary hypertension, a health care professional examines you and asks about your symptoms. You'll likely be asked questions about your medical and family history.\nTests\nTests done to help diagnose pulmonary hypertension may include:\n\nBlood tests. Blood tests can help find the cause of pulmonary hypertension or show signs of complications.\nChest X-ray. A chest X-ray creates pictures of the heart, lungs and chest. It may be used to check for other lung conditions that can cause pulmonary hypertension.\nElectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). This simple test records the electrical activity of the heart. It can show changes in the heartbeat.\n\nEchocardiogram. Sound waves are used to create moving images of the beating heart. An echocardiogram shows blood flow through the heart. This test may be done to help diagnose pulmonary hypertension or to determine how well treatments are working.\nSometimes, an echocardiogram is done while exercising on a stationary bike or treadmill to learn how activity affects the heart. If you have this test, you may be asked to wear a mask that checks how well the heart and lungs use oxygen and carbon dioxide.\n\n\nRight heart catheterization. If an echocardiogram shows pulmonary hypertension, this test may be done to confirm the diagnosis.\nDuring this procedure, a cardiologist places a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the neck. The catheter is gently guided into the lower right heart chamber and the pulmonary artery. A doctor can then measure blood pressure in the main pulmonary arteries and the right ventricle.\n\n\nOther tests may be done to check the condition of the lungs and pulmonary arteries. The following tests may give more information about the cause of pulmonary hypertension:\n\nExercise stress tests. These tests often involve walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while the heartbeat is watched. They can show how the heart reacts to exercise.\n\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan. This test uses X-rays to create cross-sectional images of specific parts of the body. Dye called contrast may be given into a vein to help the blood vessels show up more clearly on the images.\nA heart CT scan, called a cardiac CT scan, can show the size of the heart and any blockages in the pulmonary arteries. It can help diagnose lung diseases that might lead to pulmonary hypertension such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the heart. It can show blood flow in the pulmonary arteries and determine how well the right lower heart chamber is working.\nLung function test. For this test, you blow into a special device. The device measures how much air the lungs can hold. It shows how air flows in and out of the lungs.\nSleep study. A sleep study measures brain activity, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and other things as you sleep. The test can help diagnose sleep apnea, which can cause pulmonary hypertension.\nVentilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan. In this test, a radioactive tracer is given through a vein (IV). The tracer shows blood flow. You also may breathe in a tracer that shows airflow to the lungs. A V/Q scan can show whether blood clots are causing symptoms of pulmonary hypertension.\nLung biopsy. Rarely, a sample of tissue may be taken from the lung to check for a possible cause of pulmonary hypertension.\n\nGenetic testing\nScreening for gene changes that cause pulmonary hypertension may be recommended. If you have these gene changes, other family members may need to be screened too.\nPulmonary hypertension functional classification\nOnce a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is confirmed, the condition is classified according to how the symptoms affect you and your ability to do everyday tasks.\nPulmonary hypertension may fall into one of the following groups:\n\nClass I. Pulmonary hypertension is diagnosed, but there are no symptoms during rest or exercise.\nClass II. There are no symptoms at rest. Everyday chores or activities such as going to work or the grocery store may cause some shortness of breath or mild chest pain. There's a slight limitation of physical activity.\nClass III. It's comfortable at rest, but doing simple tasks such as bathing, dressing or preparing meals causes fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain. The ability to do physical activity becomes very limited.\nClass IV. Symptoms occur at rest and during physical activity. Any type of activity causes increasing discomfort.\n\nYour health care team may use a risk calculator that considers your symptoms and test results to understand what type of treatment is needed. This is called pulmonary hypertension risk stratification.\n\nCare at Mayo Clinic\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your pulmonary hypertension-related health concerns\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\n\n\nMore InformationPulmonary hypertension care at Mayo ClinicCardiac catheterizationChest X-raysCT scanEchocardiogramGenetic testingMRIShow more related information", "treatment": "There's no cure for pulmonary hypertension. But treatment is available to improve symptoms and prolong life, and to keep the disease from getting worse. You also may get treatments for any health problem that might be causing pulmonary hypertension.\nIt often takes some time to find the most appropriate treatment for pulmonary hypertension. The treatments are often complex. You usually need a lot of health checkups.\nMedications\nIf you have pulmonary hypertension, you may get medicines to treat your symptoms and help you feel better. Medicines also may be used to treat or prevent complications. Treatment may include:\n\n\nMedicines to relax blood vessels. Also called vasodilators, these medicines help open narrowed blood vessels and improve blood flow. The medicine comes in many forms. It may be breathed in, taken by mouth or given by IV. Some types are given continuously through a small pump attached to the body.\nExamples of vasodilators to treat pulmonary hypertension include epoprostenol (Flolan, Veletr), treprostinil (Remodulin, Tyvaso, others), Iloprost (Ventavis) and selexipag (Uptravi).\n\nSoluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. This type of medicine relaxes the pulmonary arteries and lowers pressure in the lungs. Examples include riociguat (Adempas). Do not take these medicines if you're pregnant.\nMedicines to widen blood vessels. Medicines called endothelin receptor antagonists reverse the effect of a substance in the walls of blood vessels that causes them to narrow. Such medicines include bosentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit) and ambrisentan (Letairis). They may improve energy level and symptoms. Do not take these medicines if you are pregnant.\nMedicines to increase blood flow. Medicines called phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors may be used to increase blood flow through the lungs. These medicines also are used to treat erectile dysfunction. They include sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Adcirca, Alyq, Cialis).\nHigh-dose calcium channel blockers. These medicines help relax the muscles in the walls of blood vessels. They include amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and nifedipine (Procardia). Although calcium channel blockers can be effective, only a small number of people with pulmonary hypertension improve while taking them.\nBlood thinners. Also called anticoagulants, these medicines help prevent blood clots. One example is warfarin (Jantoven). Blood-thinning medicines slow the clotting process. The medicines can increase the risk of bleeding. This is especially true if you're having surgery or a procedure that enters the body or creates an opening in the skin. Talk to your health care team about your risk.\nDigoxin (Lanoxin). This medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. It can help control irregular heartbeats.\nWater pills, also called diuretics. These medicines help the kidneys remove excess fluid from the body. This reduces the amount of work the heart has to do. Diuretics also may be used to reduce fluid buildup in the lungs, legs and belly area.\nOxygen therapy. Breathing pure oxygen is sometimes recommended as a treatment for pulmonary hypertension. This treatment may be suggested if you live at a high altitude or have sleep apnea. Some people with pulmonary hypertension need oxygen therapy all the time.\n\nSurgery or other procedures\nIf medicines do not help control the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension, surgery may be recommended. Surgeries and procedures to treat pulmonary hypertension may include:\n\nAtrial septostomy. This treatment may be recommended if medicines don't control pulmonary hypertension symptoms. In an atrial septostomy, a doctor creates an opening between the upper left and right chambers of the heart. The opening reduces the pressure on the right side of the heart. Potential complications include irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias.\nLung or heart-lung transplant. Sometimes, a lung or heart-lung transplant may be needed, especially for younger people who have idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. After a transplant, medicine must be taken for life to help reduce the chance of rejection.\n"}, "Tuberculosis": {"overview": null, "symptoms": null, "causes": null, "risk_factors": null, "complications": null, "diagnosis": null, "treatment": null}, "Hypothyroidism": {"overview": "Hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone.

And they often look like symptoms of other health problems. Because of that, a diagnosis of hypothyroidism doesn't rely on symptoms alone. It's usually based on the results of blood tests.\nThe first blood test typically done to diagnose hypothyroidism measures the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the blood. If it's high, the test is done again, along with a blood test for the thyroid hormone T-4. If the results show that TSH is high and T-4 is low, then the diagnosis is hypothyroidism. In some cases, the thyroid hormone T-3 may be measured as well.\nIf the second test shows high TSH but T-4 and T-3 are in the standard range, then the diagnosis is a condition called subclinical hypothyroidism. It usually doesn't cause any noticeable symptoms.\nTSH tests also play an important role in managing hypothyroidism over time. They help your health care provider find and maintain the right dosage of medication for you.\nThe results of these blood tests can be affected by some medicines or supplements. This includes biotin, a vitamin taken as a stand-alone supplement or as part of a multivitamin. Before you have blood tests done, tell your health care provider about any medicines or supplements you take.", "treatment": "Treatment for hypothyroidism usually includes taking the thyroid hormone medicine levothyroxine (Levo-T, Synthroid, others) every day. This medicine is taken by mouth. It returns hormone levels to a healthy range, eliminating symptoms of hypothyroidism.\nYou'll likely start to feel better one or two weeks after you begin treatment. Treatment with levothyroxine likely will be lifelong. Because the dosage you need may change, your health care provider may check your TSH level every year.\nFinding the right dosage\nTo find the right dosage of levothyroxine for you, your health care provider checks your level of TSH about 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine. You may need another blood test to check TSH again six months later. Too much levothyroxine can cause side effects, such as:\n\nTiredness.\nIncreased appetite.\nSleep problems.\nShakiness.\nPounding of the heart, sometimes called heart palpitations.\n\nLevothyroxine typically causes no side effects when used in the correct dose. If you change brands of the medicine, tell your health care provider, as the dosage may need to change.\nIf you have coronary artery disease or severe hypothyroidism, your health care provider may start treatment with a smaller amount of medicine and then slowly increase the dosage. This allows your heart to adjust to the rise in your body's metabolism.\nTaking levothyroxine correctly\nLevothyroxine is best taken on an empty stomach at the same time every day. Ideally, you take the hormone in the morning, and then wait 30 to 60 minutes before you eat or take other medicine. If you take the medicine at bedtime, wait to take it until at least four hours after your last meal or snack.\nDon't skip doses or stop taking the medicine because you feel better. If you do, it's likely that the symptoms of hypothyroidism will slowly return. If you miss a dose of levothyroxine, take two pills the next day.\nSome medicines, supplements and even some foods may affect your body's ability to absorb levothyroxine. Talk to your health care provider if you eat large amounts of soy products, or if you typically eat a high-fiber diet. Also, tell your provider if you take other medicines, especially:\n\nIron supplements or multivitamins that contain iron.\nAluminum hydroxide, which is found in some antacids.\nCalcium supplements.\n\nSubclinical hypothyroidism\nIf you are diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism, talk about treatment with your health care provider. For a mild rise in TSH, thyroid hormone medicine may not be useful. If your TSH level is higher, but still in the subclinical range, thyroid hormones may improve some symptoms."}, "Gastroenteritis": {"overview": null, "symptoms": null, "causes": null, "risk_factors": null, "complications": null, "diagnosis": null, "treatment": null}, "Bronchial Asthma": {"overview": "\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    Asthma attack\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nAsthma attack\n\n\nAsthma attack\nIf you have asthma, the inside walls of the airways in your lungs can become inflamed and swollen.

During an asthma attack, your narrowed airways make it harder to breathe, and you may cough and wheeze.\n\n\n\n\n Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled.

Your doctor will also ask you questions about your signs and symptoms and about any other health problems. \nTests to measure lung function\nYou may be given lung function tests to determine how much air moves in and out as you breathe. These tests may include:\n\nSpirometry. This test estimates the narrowing of your bronchial tubes by checking how much air you can exhale after a deep breath and how fast you can breathe out.\nPeak flow. A peak flow meter is a simple device that measures how hard you can breathe out. Lower than usual peak flow readings are a sign that your lungs may not be working as well and that your asthma may be getting worse. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to track and deal with low peak flow readings.\n\nLung function tests often are done before and after taking a medication to open your airways called a bronchodilator (brong-koh-DIE-lay-tur), such as albuterol. If your lung function improves with use of a bronchodilator, it's likely you have asthma.\nAdditional tests\nOther tests to diagnose asthma include:\n\nMethacholine challenge. Methacholine is a known asthma trigger. When inhaled, it will cause your airways to narrow slightly. If you react to the methacholine, you likely have asthma. This test may be used even if your initial lung function test is normal.\nImaging tests. A chest X-ray can help identify any structural abnormalities or diseases (such as infection) that can cause or aggravate breathing problems.\nAllergy testing. Allergy tests can be performed by a skin test or blood test. They tell you if you're allergic to pets, dust, mold or pollen. If allergy triggers are identified, your doctor may recommend allergy shots.\nNitric oxide test. This test measures the amount of the gas nitric oxide in your breath.

Treatment usually involves learning to recognize your triggers, taking steps to avoid triggers and tracking your breathing to make sure your medications are keeping symptoms under control. In case of an asthma flare-up, you may need to use a quick-relief inhaler.\nMedications\nThe right medications for you depend on a number of things \u2014 your age, symptoms, asthma triggers and what works best to keep your asthma under control.\nPreventive, long-term control medications reduce the swelling (inflammation) in your airways that leads to symptoms. Quick-relief inhalers (bronchodilators) quickly open swollen airways that are limiting breathing. In some cases, allergy medications are necessary.\nLong-term asthma control medications, generally taken daily, are the cornerstone of asthma treatment. These medications keep asthma under control on a day-to-day basis and make it less likely you'll have an asthma attack. Types of long-term control medications include:\n\n\nInhaled corticosteroids. These medications include fluticasone propionate (Flovent HFA, Flovent Diskus, Xhance), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler, Pulmicort Respules, Rhinocort), ciclesonide (Alvesco), beclomethasone (Qvar Redihaler), mometasone (Asmanex HFA, Asmanex Twisthaler) and fluticasone furoate (Arnuity Ellipta).\nYou may need to use these medications for several days to weeks before they reach their maximum benefit. Unlike oral corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids have a relatively low risk of serious side effects.\n\n\nLeukotriene modifiers. These oral medications \u2014 including montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo) \u2014 help relieve asthma symptoms.\nMontelukast has been linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Seek medical advice right away if you experience any of these reactions.\n\nCombination inhalers. These medications \u2014 such as fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair HFA, Airduo Digihaler, others), budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort), formoterol-mometasone (Dulera) and fluticasone furoate-vilanterol (Breo Ellipta) \u2014 contain a long-acting beta agonist along with a corticosteroid.\nTheophylline. Theophylline (Theo-24, Elixophyllin, Theochron) is a daily pill that helps keep the airways open by relaxing the muscles around the airways. It's not used as often as other asthma medications and requires regular blood tests.\n\nQuick-relief (rescue) medications are used as needed for rapid, short-term symptom relief during an asthma attack. They may also be used before exercise if your doctor recommends it. Types of quick-relief medications include:\n\n\nShort-acting beta agonists. These inhaled, quick-relief bronchodilators act within minutes to rapidly ease symptoms during an asthma attack. They include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) and levalbuterol (Xopenex, Xopenex HFA).\nShort-acting beta agonists can be taken using a portable, hand-held inhaler or a nebulizer, a machine that converts asthma medications to a fine mist. They're inhaled through a face mask or mouthpiece.\n\nAnticholinergic agents. Like other bronchodilators, ipratropium (Atrovent HFA) and tiotropium (Spiriva, Spiriva Respimat) act quickly to immediately relax your airways, making it easier to breathe. They're mostly used for emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but can be used to treat asthma.\nOral and intravenous corticosteroids. These medications \u2014 which include prednisone (Prednisone Intensol, Rayos) and methylprednisolone (Medrol, Depo-Medrol, Solu-Medrol) \u2014 relieve airway inflammation caused by severe asthma. They can cause serious side effects when used long term, so these drugs are used only on a short-term basis to treat severe asthma symptoms.\n\nIf you have an asthma flare-up, a quick-relief inhaler can ease your symptoms right away. But you shouldn't need to use your quick-relief inhaler very often if your long-term control medications are working properly.\nKeep a record of how many puffs you use each week. If you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often than your doctor recommends, see your doctor. You probably need to adjust your long-term control medication.\nAllergy medications may help if your asthma is triggered or worsened by allergies. These include:\n\nAllergy shots (immunotherapy). Over time, allergy shots gradually reduce your immune system reaction to specific allergens. You generally receive shots once a week for a few months, then once a month for a period of three to five years.\nBiologics. These medications \u2014 which include omalizumab (Xolair), mepolizumab (Nucala), dupilumab (Dupixent), reslizumab (Cinqair) and benralizumab (Fasenra) \u2014 are specifically for people who have severe asthma.\n\nBronchial thermoplasty\nThis treatment is used for severe asthma that doesn't improve with inhaled corticosteroids or other long-term asthma medications. It isn't widely available nor right for everyone.\nDuring bronchial thermoplasty, your doctor heats the insides of the airways in the lungs with an electrode. The heat reduces the smooth muscle inside the airways. This limits the ability of the airways to tighten, making breathing easier and possibly reducing asthma attacks. The therapy is generally done over three outpatient visits.\nTreat by severity for better control: A stepwise approach\nYour treatment should be flexible and based on changes in your symptoms. Your doctor should ask about your symptoms at each visit. Based on your signs and symptoms, your doctor can adjust your treatment accordingly.\nFor example, if your asthma is well controlled, your doctor may prescribe less medication. If your asthma isn't well controlled or is getting worse, your doctor may increase your medication and recommend more-frequent visits.\nAsthma action plan\nWork with your doctor to create an asthma action plan that outlines in writing when to take certain medications or when to increase or decrease the dose of your medications based on your symptoms. Also include a list of your triggers and the steps you need to take to avoid them.\nYour doctor may also recommend tracking your asthma symptoms or using a peak flow meter on a regular basis to monitor how well your treatment is controlling your asthma."}, "Hepatitis D": {"overview": "\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    The liver\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nThe liver\n\n\nThe liver\nThe liver is the largest organ in the body.

The sooner this medication is administered, the greater the chance of limiting liver damage. It's most effective if administered within 16 hours of the acetaminophen overdose.\nEmergency care. For people who overdose on a toxic medication, emergency care is essential. People who overdose on certain medications other than acetaminophen may benefit from treatments to remove the offending medication from the body or reduce its toxic effect.\n\nLiver transplant. When liver function is severely impaired, a liver transplant may be the only option for some people. A liver transplant is an operation to remove your diseased liver and replace it with a healthy liver from a donor.\nMost livers used in liver transplants come from deceased donors. In some cases, livers can come from living donors who donate a portion of their livers.\n\n"}, "Arthritis": {"overview": "\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    Osteoarthritis vs. rheumatoid arthritis\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nOsteoarthritis vs. rheumatoid arthritis\n\n\nOsteoarthritis vs. rheumatoid arthritis\nOsteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, involves the wearing away of the cartilage that caps the bones in your joints.

X-rays may not reveal early arthritic damage, but they are often used to track progression of the disease.\nComputerized tomography (CT). CT scanners take X-rays from many different angles and combine the information to create cross-sectional views of internal structures. CTs can visualize both bone and the surrounding soft tissues.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combining radio waves with a strong magnetic field, MRIs can produce more-detailed cross-sectional images of soft tissues such as cartilage, tendons and ligaments.\nUltrasound. This technology uses high-frequency sound waves to image soft tissues, cartilage and fluid-containing structures near the joints (bursae). Ultrasound is also used to guide needle placement for removing joint fluid or injecting medications into the joint.\n\nMore InformationArthroscopyCT scanMRIUltrasoundX-rayShow more related information", "treatment": "Arthritis treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and improving joint function. You may need to try several different treatments, or combinations of treatments, before you determine what works best for you.\nMedications\nThe medications used to treat arthritis vary depending on the type of arthritis. Commonly used arthritis medications include:\n\nNSAIDs. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Examples include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Stronger NSAIDs can cause stomach irritation and may increase your risk of heart attack or stroke. NSAIDs are also available as creams or gels, which can be rubbed on joints.\nCounterirritants. Some varieties of creams and ointments contain menthol or capsaicin, the ingredient that makes hot peppers spicy. Rubbing these preparations on the skin over your aching joint may interfere with the transmission of pain signals from the joint itself.\nSteroids. Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, reduce inflammation and pain and slow joint damage. Corticosteroids may be given as a pill or as an injection into the painful joint. Side effects may include thinning of bones, weight gain and diabetes.\nDisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These drugs can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and save the joints and other tissues from permanent damage. In addition to conventional DMARDs, there are also biologic agents and targeted synthetic DMARDs. Side effects vary but most DMARDs increase your risk of infections.\n\nTherapy\nPhysical therapy can be helpful for some types of arthritis. Exercises can improve range of motion and strengthen the muscles surrounding joints. In some cases, splints or braces may be warranted.\nSurgery\nIf conservative measures don't help, doctors may suggest surgery, such as:\n\nJoint repair. In some instances, joint surfaces can be smoothed or realigned to reduce pain and improve function. These types of procedures can often be performed arthroscopically \u2014 through small incisions over the joint.\nJoint replacement. This procedure removes the damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial one. Joints most commonly replaced are hips and knees.\nJoint fusion. This procedure is more often used for smaller joints, such as those in the wrist, ankle and fingers. It removes the ends of the two bones in the joint and then locks those ends together until they heal into one rigid unit.\n"}, "Hepatitis B": {"overview": "\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    The liver\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nThe liver\n\n\nThe liver\nThe liver is the largest organ in the body.

A Mayo Clinic expert explains\n\nHi, I'm Dr. Amaal Starling, a neurologist at Mayo Clinic specializing in headache disorders. In this video, we will cover the basics of migraine. What is it? Who gets it, the symptoms, the diagnosis, and most importantly, the treatment. Whether you're looking for answers for yourself or someone you love, we are here to give you the best information available. There is a lot of stigma around migraine. That it's just a headache and that it's no big deal. But migraine is a genetic neurologic disease. It affects each person differently with a wide range of disease severity. Some have infrequent attacks, but others may have frequent disabling attacks. Expecting someone to push through or just take your mind off of it is never good advice.\nWho gets it?\nMigraine is very common, affecting one in five women, one in 16 men, and even one in 11 children. Migraine attacks are three times more prevalent in women, likely as a result of hormonal differences. Certainly genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of migraine disease. And since it is genetic, it is hereditary. Meaning if a parent has migraine, there's about a 50 percent chance that a child may develop migraine as well. If you have migraine, certain factors can trigger an attack. However, this does not mean that if you get a migraine attack, that it's their fault, that you should feel any guilt or shame for your symptoms. Hormonal changes, specifically fluctuations and estrogen that can occur during menstrual periods, pregnancy and perimenopause can trigger a migraine attack. Other known triggers include certain medications, drinking alcohol, especially red wine, drinking too much caffeine, stress. Sensory stimulation such as bright lights or strong smells. Sleep changes, weather changes, skipping meals or even certain foods like aged cheeses and processed foods.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nThe most common symptom of migraine is the intense throbbing head pain. This pain can be so severe that it interferes with your day-to-day activities. It can also be accompanied by nausea and vomiting, as well as sensitivity to light and sound. However, a migraine can look very different from one person to another. Some people may get prodrome symptoms, the beginning of a migraine attack. These can be subtle warnings such as constipation, mood changes, food cravings, neck stiffness, increased urination, or even frequent yawning. Sometimes people may not even realize that these are warning signs of a migraine attack. In about a third of people living with migraine, aura might occur before or even during a migraine attack. Aura is the term that we use for these temporary reversible neurologic symptoms. They're usually visual, but they can include other neurologic symptoms as well. They typically built up over several minutes and they can last for up to an hour. Examples of migraine aura include visual phenomena such as seeing geometric shapes or bright spots, or flashing lights, or even loss of vision. Some people may develop numbness or a pins and needles sensation on one side of their face or body, or even difficulty speaking. At the end of a migraine attack, you might feel drained, confused, or washed out for up to a day. This is called the post-drome phase.\nHow is it diagnosed?\nMigraine is a clinical diagnosis. That means the diagnosis is based on the symptoms reported by the patient. There is no lab test or imaging study that can rule in or rule out migraine. Based on screening diagnostic criteria, if you have the symptoms of headache associated with sensitivity to light, a decrease in function and nausea, you likely have migraine. Please see your healthcare professional for the possible diagnosis of migraine and migraine specific treatment.\nHow is it treated?\nBecause there is such a wide spectrum of disease severity with migraine, there's also a wide spectrum of management plans. Some people need what we call an acute or a rescue treatment for infrequent migraine attacks. Whereas other people need both an acute and a preventive treatment plan. Preventive treatment reduces the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. It might be a daily oral medication, a monthly injection, or even injections and infusions that are delivered once every three months. The right medications combined with lifestyle changes can be helpful to improve the lives of those living with migraine. There are ways to manage and minimize the triggers of migraine using the SEEDS method. The S is for sleep. Improve your sleep routine by sticking to a specific schedule, reducing screens and distractions at night. E is for exercise. Start small, even five minutes once a week and slowly increase the duration and frequency to make it a habit. And stick to movement and activities that you enjoy. E is for eat healthy, well-balanced meals at least three times a day and stay hydrated. The D is for diary. Track your migraine days and symptoms in a diary. Use a calendar, an agenda, or an app. Bring that diary with you to your follow-up appointments with your doctor to review. The S is for stress management to help manage migraine attacks triggered by stress. Consider therapy, mindfulness, biofeedback, and other relaxation techniques that work for you.\nWhat now?\nMigraine attacks can be disabling, but there are ways to manage the disease and to empower yourself to get the care and the support that you need. First. We need to end the stigma around migraine. It is not just a headache, it is a genetic neurologic disease. Next, talk to your healthcare professional about your symptoms. Eradicate the words \"I'm fine\" from your vocabulary and be honest with your healthcare professional, your employer, your loved ones, about how you're feeling as well as the kind of support that you need. Make yourself a top priority when you're having a migraine attack and reduce the likelihood of attacks through lifestyle adjustments. Have a consistent schedule, get adequate sleep, and learn strategies to cope with the stresses of life using mindfulness and meditation. Empower yourself to manage migraine with lifestyle changes and migraine specific treatment options. Together you and your doctor can manage the disease of migraine.

We wish you well.\n\n A migraine is a headache that can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head. It's often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so bad that it interferes with your daily activities. For some people, a warning symptom known as an aura occurs before or with the headache. An aura can include visual disturbances, such as flashes of light or blind spots, or other disturbances, such as tingling on one side of the face or in an arm or leg and difficulty speaking.

And I'm here to answer some of the important questions that you might have about migraine.\nWhy doesn't migraine show up on MRI?\nMigraine is a disease of abnormal function within the setting of normal brain structure. An MRI of the brain solely tells you about the structure of the brain but tells you very little about the function of the brain. And that is why migraine doesn't show up on an MRI. Because it's abnormal function in the setting of normal structure.\nHow can this much pain be just migraine?\nMigraine is highly disabling for some individuals. In fact, it is the second leading cause of disability worldwide. Disabling symptoms are not just the pain, but also the sensitivity to light and sound, as well as the nausea and vomiting.\nDo I need daily treatment if I don\u2019t have daily attacks?\nThere is a wide range of disease severity in migraine. There are some people who only need a rescue or an acute treatment for migraine because they have infrequent migraine attacks. But there are other people who are having frequent migraine attacks, maybe two or three times a week. If they used rescue treatments for every attack, it could potentially lead to other complications. Those individuals need a preventive treatment regimen to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Those preventive treatments might be daily medications. They might be once a month injections or other injectable medications delivered once every three months.\nWhat should I do on the days I can\u2019t take my rescue medication?\nThis is why preventive treatment is so crucial. With preventive treatment, we can reduce the frequency as well as the severity of attacks so that you're not having attacks more than two times per week. However, for some individuals, despite preventive treatment, they may still have migraine symptoms more frequently throughout the week. For them, there are non-medication options for treating pain, such as biofeedback, relaxation techniques, cognitive behavioral therapy, as well as a number of devices that are non-medication options for treating migraine pain.\nShould I consider neurotoxin injections for migraine?\nYes, that is an option for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. These onabotulinum toxin A injections are administered by your doctor once every 12 weeks to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. However, there are many different preventive treatment options. And it is important for you to speak with your doctor about which option is best for you.\nHow can I be the best partner to my medical team?\nThe best way to partner with your medical team is to, number one, get a medical team. Many people living with migraine have not even talked to a doctor about their symptoms. If you have headaches where you have to rest in a dark room, where you might get sick to your stomach. Please talk to your healthcare professional about your symptoms. You might have migraine and we can treat migraine. Migraine is a chronic disease. And to best manage this disease, patients need to understand the disease. This is why I prescribe advocacy to all of my patients. Learn about migraine, join patient advocacy organizations, share your journey with others, and become empowered through advocacy and efforts to shatter the stigma of migraine. And together, the patient and the medical team can manage the disease of migraine. Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns that you have. Being informed makes all the difference. Thanks for your time and we wish you well.\n\n\nIf you have migraines or a family history of migraines, a specialist trained in treating headaches, known as a neurologist, will likely diagnose migraines based on your medical history, symptoms, and a physical and neurological examination.\nIf your condition is unusual, complex or suddenly becomes severe, tests to rule out other causes for your pain might include:\n\nAn MRI scan. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain and blood vessels. MRI scans help diagnose tumors, strokes, bleeding in the brain, infections, and other brain and nervous system, known as neurological, conditions.\nA CT scan. A computerized tomography (CT) scan uses a series of X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the brain. This helps  diagnose tumors, infections, brain damage, bleeding in the brain and other possible medical problems that may be causing headaches.\n\n\nCare at Mayo Clinic\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOur caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your migraine-related health concerns\r\n\t\t\t\t\tStart Here\n\n\n\nMore InformationMigraine care at Mayo ClinicCT scanLumbar puncture (spinal tap)MRIShow more related information", "treatment": "Migraine treatment is aimed at stopping symptoms and preventing future attacks.\nMany medications have been designed to treat migraines.

Also known as acute or abortive treatment, these types of drugs are taken during migraine attacks and are designed to stop symptoms.\nPreventive medications. These types of drugs are taken regularly, often daily, to reduce the severity or frequency of migraines.\n\nYour treatment choices depend on the frequency and severity of your headaches, whether you have nausea and vomiting with your headaches, how disabling your headaches are, and other medical conditions you have.\nMedications for relief\nMedications used to relieve migraine pain work best when taken at the first sign of an oncoming migraine \u2014 as soon as symptoms of a migraine begin.  Medications that can be used to treat it include:\n\n\nPain relievers. These over-the-counter or prescription pain relievers include aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others).

Prescription drugs such as sumatriptan (Imitrex, Tosymra) and rizatriptan (Maxalt, Maxalt-MLT) are used to treat migraine because they block pain pathways in the brain. Taken as pills, shots or nasal sprays, they can relieve many symptoms of migraine. They might not be safe for those at risk of a stroke or heart attack.\n\nDihydroergotamine (Migranal, Trudhesa). Available as a nasal spray or injection, this drug is most effective when taken shortly after the start of migraine symptoms for migraines that tend to last longer than 24 hours. Side effects can include worsening of migraine-related vomiting and nausea.\nPeople with coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, or kidney or liver disease should avoid dihydroergotamine.\n\nLasmiditan (Reyvow). This newer oral tablet is approved for the treatment of migraine with or without aura. In drug trials, lasmiditan significantly improved headache pain. Lasmiditan can have a sedative effect and cause dizziness, so people taking it are advised not to drive or operate machinery for at least eight hours.\nOral calcitonin gene-related peptides antagonists, known as gepants. Ubrogepant (Ubrelvy) and rimegepant (Nurtec ODT) are oral gepants approved for the treatment of migraine in adults. In drug trials, medicines from this class were more effective than placebo at relieving pain two hours after taking them. They also were effective at treating migraine symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. Common side effects include dry mouth, nausea and too much sleepiness. Ubrogepant and rimegepant should not be taken with strong CYP3A4 inhibitor medicines such as some medicines used to treat cancer. \n\nIntranasal zavegepant (Zavzpret). The Food and Drug Administration recently approved this nasal spray to treat migraines. Zavegepant is a gepant and the only migraine medicine that comes as a nasal spray. It brings migraine pain relief within 15 minutes to 2 hours after taking a single dose. The medicine continues working for up to 48 hours. It also can improve other symptoms related to migraine, such as nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.\nCommon side effects of zavegepant include a change in sense of taste, nasal discomfort and throat irritation.\n\nOpioid medications. For people who can't take other migraine medications, narcotic opioid medications might help. Because they can be highly addictive, these are usually used only if no other treatments are effective.\nAnti-nausea drugs. These can help if your migraine with aura is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Anti-nausea drugs include chlorpromazine, metoclopramide (Gimoti, Reglan) or prochlorperazine (Compro, Compazine). These are usually taken with pain medications.\n\nSome of these medications are not safe to take during pregnancy. If you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant, don't use any of these medications without first talking with your health care provider.\nPreventive medications\nMedications can help prevent frequent migraines. Your\u00a0health care provider might recommend preventive medications if you have frequent, long-lasting or severe headaches that don't respond well to treatment.\nPreventive medication is aimed at reducing how often you get a migraine, how severe the attacks are and how long they last. Options include:\n\nBlood pressure-lowering medications. These include beta blockers such as propranolol (Inderal, InnoPran), Hemangeol) and metoprolol (Lopressor). Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil (Verelan, Calan) can be helpful in preventing migraines with aura.\nAntidepressants. A tricyclic antidepressant, amitriptyline, can prevent migraines. Because of the side effects of amitriptyline, such as sleepiness, other antidepressants might be prescribed instead.\nAnti-seizure drugs. Valproate and topiramate (Topamax, Qudexy, others) might help if you have less frequent migraines, but can cause side effects such as dizziness, weight changes, nausea and more. These medications are not recommended for pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant.\nBotox injections. Injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) about every 12 weeks help prevent migraines in some adults.\nCalcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies. Erenumab-aooe (Aimovig), fremanezumab-vfrm (Ajovy), galcanezumab-gnlm (Emgality), and eptinezumab-jjmr (Vyepti) are newer medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat migraines. They're given monthly or quarterly by injection. The most common side effect is a reaction at the injection site.\nAtogepant (Qulipta). This medicine is a gepant that helps prevent migraines. It's a tablet taken by mouth daily. Potential side effects of the medicine may include nausea, constipation and fatigue.\nRimegepant (Nurtec ODT). This medicine is unique in that it's a gepant that helps prevent migraines in addition to treating migraines as needed.\n\nAsk your health care provider if these medications are right for you. Some of these medications are not safe to take during pregnancy. If you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant, don't use any of these medications without first talking with your provider."}, "Chicken pox": {"overview": null, "symptoms": null, "causes": null, "risk_factors": null, "complications": null, "diagnosis": null, "treatment": null}, "Paralysis (brain hemorrhage)": {"overview": "\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    Brain AVM\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nBrain AVM\n\n\nBrain AVM\nIn a brain AVM, blood passes directly from the arteries to the veins via tangled vessels.

The best approach for you depends on your age and health. The underlying cause of hyperthyroidism and how severe it is make a difference too. Your personal preference also should be considered as you and your health care provider decide on a treatment plan. Treatment may include:\n\n\nAnti-thyroid medicine. These medications slowly ease symptoms of hyperthyroidism by preventing the thyroid gland from making too many hormones. Anti-thyroid medications include methimazole and propylthiouracil. Symptoms usually begin to improve within several weeks to months.\nTreatment with anti-thyroid medicine typically lasts 12 to 18 months. After that, the dose may be slowly decreased or stopped if symptoms go away and if blood test results show that thyroid hormone levels have returned to the standard range. For some people, anti-thyroid medicine puts hyperthyroidism into long-term remission. But other people may find that hyperthyroidism comes back after this treatment.\nAlthough rare, serious liver damage can happen with both anti-thyroid medications. But because propylthiouracil has caused many more cases of liver damage, it's generally used only when people can't take methimazole. A small number of people who are allergic to these medicines may develop skin rashes, hives, fever or joint pain. They also can raise the risk of infection.\nBeta blockers. These medicines don't affect thyroid hormone levels. But they can lessen symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as a tremor, rapid heart rate and heart palpitations. Sometimes, health care providers prescribe them to ease symptoms until thyroid hormones are closer to a standard level. These medicines generally aren't recommended for people who have asthma. Side effects may include fatigue and sexual problems.\nRadioiodine therapy. The thyroid gland takes up radioiodine. This treatment causes the gland to shrink. This medicine is taken by mouth. With this treatment, symptoms typically lessen within several months. This treatment usually causes thyroid activity to slow enough to make the thyroid gland underactive. That condition is hypothyroidism. Because of that, over time, you may need to take medicine to replace thyroid hormones.\nThyroidectomy. This is surgery to remove part of or all of the thyroid gland. It is not used often to treat hyperthyroidism. But it may be an option for people who are pregnant. It also may be a choice for those who can't take anti-thyroid medicine and don't want to or can't take radioiodine therapy.\nRisks of this surgery include damage to the vocal cords and parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands are four tiny glands on the back of the thyroid. They help control the level of calcium in the blood.\nPeople who have a thyroidectomy or radioiodine therapy need lifelong treatment with the medicine levothyroxine (Levoxyl, Synthroid, others). It supplies the body with thyroid hormones. If the parathyroid glands are removed during surgery, medicine also is needed to keep blood calcium in a healthy range.\n\nThyroid eye disease\nIf you have thyroid eye disease, you may be able to manage mild symptoms with self-care steps, such as artificial tear drops and lubricating eye gels. Avoiding wind and bright lights can help too.\nMore-severe symptoms may need treatment with medicine called corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone or prednisone. They can lessen swelling behind the eyeballs. The medicine teprotumumab (Tepezza) also may be used to control moderate to severe symptoms. If those medicines don't ease symptoms, other medicines are sometimes used to treat thyroid eye disease. They include, tocilizumab (Actemra), rituximab (Rituxan) and mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept).\nIn some cases, surgery may be needed to treat thyroid eye disease, including:\n\nOrbital decompression surgery. In this surgery, the bone between the eye socket and the sinuses is removed. This surgery can improve vision. It also gives the eyes more room, so they can go back to their usual position. There is a risk of complications with this surgery. If you have double vision before the surgery, it may not go away afterward. Some people develop double vision after the surgery.\nEye muscle surgery. Sometimes scar tissue from thyroid eye disease can cause one or more eye muscles to be too short. This pulls the eyes out of alignment, causing double vision. Eye muscle surgery may correct double vision by cutting the muscle from the eyeball and attaching it again farther back.\n"}, "Hepatitis C": {"overview": "\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    The liver\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nThe liver\n\n\nThe liver\nThe liver is the largest organ in the body.

People with severe symptoms are likely to receive supportive therapy in the hospital, including intravenous fluids and medication to relieve nausea and vomiting. Your doctor will also monitor for liver damage.\nMedication to reverse liver damage caused by acetaminophen. If your liver damage was caused by an overdose of acetaminophen, you'll receive a chemical called acetylcysteine right away. The sooner this medication is administered, the greater the chance of limiting liver damage. It's most effective if administered within 16 hours of the acetaminophen overdose.\nEmergency care. For people who overdose on a toxic medication, emergency care is essential. People who overdose on certain medications other than acetaminophen may benefit from treatments to remove the offending medication from the body or reduce its toxic effect.\n\nLiver transplant. When liver function is severely impaired, a liver transplant may be the only option for some people.

Psoriasis is a common, long-term (chronic) disease with no cure. It can be painful, interfere with sleep and make it hard to concentrate. The condition tends to go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a while.

Options include creams and ointments (topical therapy), light therapy (phototherapy), and oral or injected medications.\nWhich treatments you use depends on how severe the psoriasis is and how responsive it has been to previous treatment and self-care measures. You might need to try different drugs or a combination of treatments before you find an approach that works. Even with successful treatment, usually the disease returns.\nTopical therapy\n\n\nCorticosteroids. These drugs are the most frequently prescribed medications for treating mild to moderate psoriasis. They are available as oils, ointments, creams, lotions, gels, foams, sprays and shampoos. Mild corticosteroid ointments (hydrocortisone) are usually recommended for sensitive areas, such as the face or skin folds, and for treating widespread patches. Topical corticosteroids might be applied once a day during flares, and on alternate days or weekends during remission.\nYour health care provider may prescribe a stronger corticosteroid cream or ointment \u2014 triamcinolone (Trianex) or clobetasol (Cormax, Temovate, others) \u2014 for smaller, less-sensitive or tougher-to-treat areas.\nLong-term use or overuse of strong corticosteroids can thin the skin. Over time, topical corticosteroids may stop working.\n\nVitamin D analogues. Synthetic forms of vitamin D \u2014 such as calcipotriene (Dovonex, Sorilux) and calcitriol (Vectical) \u2014 slow skin cell growth. This type of drug may be used alone or with topical corticosteroids. Calcitriol may cause less irritation in sensitive areas. Calcipotriene and calcitriol are usually more expensive than topical corticosteroids.\n\nRetinoids. Tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, others) is available as a gel or cream. It's applied once or twice daily. The most common side effects are skin irritation and increased sensitivity to light.\nTazarotene isn't recommended when you're pregnant or breastfeeding or if you intend to become pregnant.\n\n\nCalcineurin inhibitors. Calcineurin inhibitors \u2014 such as tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) \u2014 calm the rash and reduce scaly buildup. They can be especially helpful in areas of thin skin, such as around the eyes, where steroid creams or retinoids are irritating or harmful.\nCalcineurin inhibitors aren't recommended when you're pregnant or breastfeeding or if you intend to become pregnant. This drug is also not intended for long-term use because of a potential increased risk of skin cancer and lymphoma.\n\nSalicylic acid. Salicylic acid shampoos and scalp solutions reduce the scaling of scalp psoriasis. They are available in nonprescription or prescription strengths. This type of product may be used alone or with other topical therapy, as it prepares the scalp to absorb the medication more easily.\n\nCoal tar. Coal tar reduces scaling, itching and inflammation. It's available in nonprescription and prescription strengths. It comes in various forms, such as shampoo, cream and oil. These products can irritate the skin. They're also messy, stain clothing and bedding, and can have a strong odor.\nCoal tar treatment isn't recommended when you're pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nAnthralin. Anthralin is a tar cream that slows skin cell growth. It can also remove scales and make skin smoother. It's not intended for use on the face or genitals. Anthralin can irritate skin, and it stains almost anything it touches. It's usually applied for a short time and then washed off.\n\nLight therapy\nLight therapy is a first line treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis, either alone or in combination with medications. It involves exposing the skin to controlled amounts of natural or artificial light. Repeated treatments are necessary. Talk with your health care provider about whether home phototherapy is an option for you.\n\nSunlight. Brief, daily exposures to sunlight (heliotherapy) might improve psoriasis. Before beginning a sunlight regimen, ask your health care provider about the safest way to use natural light for psoriasis treatment.\nGoeckerman therapy. An approach that combines coal tar treatment with light therapy is called the Goeckerman therapy. This can be more effective because coal tar makes skin more responsive to ultraviolet B (UVB) light.\nUVB broadband. Controlled doses of UVB broadband light from an artificial light source can treat single psoriasis patches, widespread psoriasis and psoriasis that doesn't improve with topical treatments. Short-term side effects might include inflamed, itchy, dry skin.\nUVB narrowband. UVB narrowband light therapy might be more effective than UVB broadband treatment. In many places it has replaced broadband therapy. It's usually administered two or three times a week until the skin improves and then less frequently for maintenance therapy. But narrowband UVB phototherapy may cause more-severe side effects than UVB broadband.\n\nPsoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). This treatment involves taking a light-sensitizing medication (psoralen) before exposing the affected skin to UVA light. UVA light penetrates deeper into the skin than does UVB light, and psoralen makes the skin more responsive to UVA exposure.\nThis more aggressive treatment consistently improves skin and is often used for more-severe psoriasis. Short-term side effects might include nausea, headache, burning and itching. Possible long-term side effects include dry and wrinkled skin, freckles, increased sun sensitivity, and increased risk of skin cancer, including melanoma.\n\nExcimer laser. With this form of light therapy, a strong UVB light targets only the affected skin. Excimer laser therapy requires fewer sessions than does traditional phototherapy because more-powerful UVB light is used. Side effects might include inflammation and blistering.\n\nOral or injected medications\nIf you have moderate to severe psoriasis, or if other treatments haven't worked, your health care provider may prescribe oral or injected (systemic) drugs. Some of these drugs are used for only brief periods and might be alternated with other treatments because they have potential for severe side effects.\n\nSteroids. If you have a few small, persistent psoriasis patches, your health care provider might suggest an injection of triamcinolone right into them.\nRetinoids. Acitretin and other retinoids are pills used to reduce the production of skin cells. Side effects might include dry skin and muscle soreness. These drugs are not recommended when you're pregnant or breastfeeding or if you intend to become pregnant.\n\nBiologics. These drugs, usually administered by injection, alter the immune system in a way that disrupts the disease cycle and improves symptoms and signs of disease within weeks. Several of these drugs are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in people who haven't responded to first line therapies. Options include apremilast (Otezla), etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), ustekinumab (Stelara), secukinumab (Cosentyx), ixekizumab (Taltz), guselkumab (Tremfya), tildrakizumab (Ilumya) and certolizumab (Cimzia). Three of them \u2014 etanercept, ixekizumab and ustekinumab \u2014 are approved for children. These types of drugs are expensive and may or may not be covered by health insurance plans.\nBiologics must be used with caution because they carry the risk of suppressing the immune system in ways that increase the risk of serious infections. People taking these treatments must be screened for tuberculosis.\n\n\nMethotrexate. Usually administered weekly as a single oral dose, methotrexate (Trexall) decreases the production of skin cells and suppresses inflammation. It's less effective than adalimumab and infliximab. It might cause upset stomach, loss of appetite and fatigue. People taking methotrexate long-term need ongoing testing to monitor their blood counts and liver function.\nPeople need to stop taking methotrexate at least three months before attempting to conceive. This drug is not recommended for those who are breastfeeding.\n\n\nCyclosporine. Taken orally for severe psoriasis, cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune) suppresses the immune system. It's similar to methotrexate in effectiveness but cannot be used continuously for more than a year. Like other immunosuppressant drugs, cyclosporine increases the risk of infection and other health problems, including cancer. People taking cyclosporine long-term need ongoing testing to monitor their blood pressure and kidney function.\nThese drugs aren't recommended when you're pregnant or breastfeeding or if you intend to become pregnant.\n\nOther medications. Thioguanine (Tabloid) and hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) are medications that can be used when you can't take other drugs. Talk with your health care provider about possible side effects of these drugs.\n\nTreatment considerations\nYou and your health care provider will choose a treatment approach based on your needs and the type and severity of your psoriasis. You'll likely start with the mildest treatments \u2014 topical creams and ultraviolet light therapy (phototherapy). Then, if your condition doesn't improve, you might move on to stronger treatments.\nPeople with pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis usually need to start with stronger (systemic) medications.\nIn any situation, the goal is to find the most effective way to slow cell turnover with the fewest possible side effects.\nAlternative medicine\nSome studies claim that alternative therapies (integrative medicine) \u2014 products and practices not part of conventional medical care or that developed outside of traditional Western practice \u2014 ease the symptoms of psoriasis. Examples of alternative therapies used by people with psoriasis include special diets, vitamins, acupuncture and herbal products applied to the skin. None of these approaches is backed by strong evidence, but they are generally safe and might help reduce itching and scaling in people with mild to moderate psoriasis.\n\nAloe extract cream. Taken from the leaves of the aloe vera plant, aloe extract cream may reduce scaling, itching and inflammation. You might need to use the cream several times a day for a month or more to see any improvement in your skin.\nFish oil supplements. Oral fish oil therapy used in combination with UVB therapy might reduce the extent of the rash. Applying fish oil to the affected skin and covering it with a dressing for six hours a day for four weeks might improve scaling.\nOregon grape. Oregon grape \u2014 also known as barberry \u2014 is applied to the skin and may reduce the severity of psoriasis.\n\nIf you're considering alternative medicine to ease the signs and symptoms of psoriasis, talk with your health care provider about the pros and cons of these approaches."}, "Dengue": {"overview": "Dengue (DENG-gey) fever is a mosquito-borne illness that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world.

Sclerotherapy doesn't require anesthesia and can be done in a health care provider's office.\n\nLaser treatment. Laser treatment sends strong bursts of light onto the vein, which makes the vein slowly fade and disappear. No cuts or needles are used.\nCatheter-based procedures using radiofrequency or laser energy. This procedure is the preferred treatment for larger varicose veins. A health care provider inserts a thin tube (catheter) into an enlarged vein and heats the tip of the catheter using either radiofrequency or laser energy. As the catheter is removed, the heat destroys the vein by causing it to collapse and seal shut.\nHigh ligation and vein stripping. This procedure involves tying off a vein before it joins a deep vein and removing the vein through small cuts. This is an outpatient procedure for most people. Removing the vein won't keep blood from flowing in the leg because veins deeper in the leg take care of the larger volumes of blood.\nAmbulatory phlebectomy (fluh-BEK-tuh-me).

That sugar also is called glucose. This long-term condition results in too much sugar circulating in the blood. Eventually, high blood sugar levels can lead to disorders of the circulatory, nervous and immune systems. In type 2 diabetes, there are primarily two problems. The pancreas does not produce enough insulin \u2014 a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into the cells. And cells respond poorly to insulin and take in less sugar. Type 2 diabetes used to be known as adult-onset diabetes, but both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. Type 2 is more common in older adults. But the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more cases of type 2 diabetes in younger people. There's no cure for type 2 diabetes.

If diet and exercise aren't enough to control blood sugar, diabetes medications or insulin therapy may be recommended.", "symptoms": "Increased thirst.\nFrequent urination.\nIncreased hunger.\nUnintended weight loss.\nFatigue.\nBlurred vision.\nSlow-healing sores.\nFrequent infections.\nNumbness or tingling in the hands or feet.\nAreas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck.", "causes": "Type 2 diabetes is mainly the result of two problems:", "risk_factors": "Weight. Being overweight or obese is a main risk.\nFat distribution. Storing fat mainly in the abdomen \u2014 rather than the hips and thighs \u2014 indicates a greater risk. The risk of type 2 diabetes is higher in men with a waist circumference above 40 inches (101.6 centimeters) and in women with a waist measurement above 35 inches (88.9 centimeters).\nInactivity. The less active a person is, the greater the risk. Physical activity helps control weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes cells more sensitive to insulin.\nFamily history. An individual's risk of type 2 diabetes increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes.\nRace and ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, people of certain races and ethnicities \u2014 including Black, Hispanic, Native American and Asian people, and Pacific Islanders \u2014 are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than white people are.\nBlood lipid levels. An increased risk is associated with low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol \u2014 the \"good\" cholesterol \u2014 and high levels of triglycerides.\nAge. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases with age, especially after age 35.\nPrediabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which the blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes.\nPregnancy-related risks. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is higher in people who had gestational diabetes when they were pregnant and in those who gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms).\nPolycystic ovary syndrome. Having polycystic ovary syndrome \u2014 a condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity \u2014 increases the risk of diabetes.", "complications": "Type 2 diabetes affects many major organs, including the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. Also, factors that increase the risk of diabetes are risk factors for other serious diseases. Managing diabetes and controlling blood sugar can lower the risk for these complications and other medical conditions, including:", "diagnosis": "Type 2 diabetes is usually diagnosed using the glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test. This blood test indicates your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months. Results are interpreted as follows:\n\nBelow 5.7% is normal.\n5.7% to 6.4% is diagnosed as prediabetes.\n6.5% or higher on two separate tests indicates diabetes.\n\nIf the A1C test isn't available, or if you have certain conditions that interfere with an A1C test, your health care provider may use the following tests to diagnose diabetes:\nRandom blood sugar test. Blood sugar values are expressed in milligrams of sugar per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles of sugar per liter (mmol/L) of blood. Regardless of when you last ate, a level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher suggests diabetes, especially if you also have symptoms of diabetes, such as frequent urination and extreme thirst.\nFasting blood sugar test. A blood sample is taken after you haven't eaten overnight. Results are interpreted as follows:\n\nLess than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is considered healthy.\n100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is diagnosed as prediabetes.\n126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests is diagnosed as diabetes.\n\nOral glucose tolerance test. This test is less commonly used than the others, except during pregnancy. You'll need to not eat for a certain amount of time and then drink a sugary liquid at your health care provider's office. Blood sugar levels then are tested periodically for two hours. Results are interpreted as follows:\n\nLess than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) after two hours is considered healthy.\n140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L and 11.0 mmol/L) is diagnosed as prediabetes.\n200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher after two hours suggests diabetes.\n\nScreening. The American Diabetes Association recommends routine screening with diagnostic tests for type 2 diabetes in all adults age 35 or older and in the following groups:\n\nPeople younger than 35 who are overweight or obese and have one or more risk factors associated with diabetes.\nWomen who have had gestational diabetes.\nPeople who have been diagnosed with prediabetes.\nChildren who are overweight or obese and who have a family history of type 2 diabetes or other risk factors.\n\nAfter a diagnosis\nIf you're diagnosed with diabetes, your health care provider may do other tests to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes because the two conditions often require different treatments.\nYour health care provider will test A1C levels at least two times a year and when there are any changes in treatment. Target A1C goals vary depending on age and other factors. For most people, the American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C level below 7%.\nYou also receive tests to screen for complications of diabetes and other medical conditions.\nMore InformationA1C testGlucose tolerance test", "treatment": "Management of type 2 diabetes includes:\n\nHealthy eating.\nRegular exercise.\nWeight loss.\nPossibly, diabetes medication or insulin therapy.\nBlood sugar monitoring.\n\nThese steps make it more likely that blood sugar will stay in a healthy range. And they may help to delay or prevent complications.\nHealthy eating\nThere's no specific diabetes diet. However, it's important to center your diet around:\n\nA regular schedule for meals and healthy snacks.\nSmaller portion sizes.\nMore high-fiber foods, such as fruits, nonstarchy vegetables and whole grains.\nFewer refined grains, starchy vegetables and sweets.\nModest servings of low-fat dairy, low-fat meats and fish.\nHealthy cooking oils, such as olive oil or canola oil.\nFewer calories.\n\nYour health care provider may recommend seeing a registered dietitian, who can help you:\n\nIdentify healthy food choices.\nPlan well-balanced, nutritional meals.\nDevelop new habits and address barriers to changing habits.\nMonitor carbohydrate intake to keep your blood sugar levels more stable.\n\nPhysical activity\nExercise is important for losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight. It also helps with managing blood sugar. Talk to your health care provider before starting or changing your exercise program to ensure that activities are safe for you.\n\nAerobic exercise. Choose an aerobic exercise that you enjoy, such as walking, swimming, biking or running. Adults should aim for 30 minutes or more of moderate aerobic exercise on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes a week.\nResistance exercise. Resistance exercise increases your strength, balance and ability to perform activities of daily living more easily. Resistance training includes weightlifting, yoga and calisthenics. Adults living with type 2 diabetes should aim for 2 to 3 sessions of resistance exercise each week.\nLimit inactivity. Breaking up long periods of inactivity, such as sitting at the computer, can help control blood sugar levels. Take a few minutes to stand, walk around or do some light activity every 30 minutes.\n\nWeight loss\nWeight loss results in better control of blood sugar levels, cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure. If you're overweight, you may begin to see improvements in these factors after losing as little as 5% of your body weight. However, the more weight you lose, the greater the benefit to your health. In some cases, losing up to 15% of body weight may be recommended.\nYour health care provider or dietitian can help you set appropriate weight-loss goals and encourage lifestyle changes to help you achieve them.\nMonitoring your blood sugar\nYour health care provider will advise you on how often to check your blood sugar level to make sure you remain within your target range. You may, for example, need to check it once a day and before or after exercise. If you take insulin, you may need to check your blood sugar multiple times a day.\nMonitoring is usually done with a small, at-home device called a blood glucose meter, which measures the amount of sugar in a drop of blood. Keep a record of your measurements to share with your health care team.\nContinuous glucose monitoring is an electronic system that records glucose levels every few minutes from a sensor placed under the skin. Information can be transmitted to a mobile device such as a phone, and the system can send alerts when levels are too high or too low.\nDiabetes medications\nIf you can't maintain your target blood sugar level with diet and exercise, your health care provider may prescribe diabetes medications that help lower glucose levels, or your provider may suggest insulin therapy. Medicines for type 2 diabetes include the following.\nMetformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, others) is generally the first medicine prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It works mainly by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin so it uses insulin more effectively.\nSome people experience B-12 deficiency and may need to take supplements. Other possible side effects, which may improve over time, include:\n\nNausea.\nAbdominal pain.\nBloating.\nDiarrhea.\n\nSulfonylureas help the body secrete more insulin. Examples include glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase), glipizide (Glucotrol XL) and glimepiride (Amaryl). Possible side effects include:\n\nLow blood sugar.\nWeight gain.\n\nGlinides stimulate the pancreas to secrete more insulin. They're faster acting than sulfonylureas. But their effect in the body is shorter. Examples include repaglinide and nateglinide. Possible side effects include:\n\nLow blood sugar.    \nWeight gain.\n\nThiazolidinediones make the body's tissues more sensitive to insulin. An example of this medicine is pioglitazone (Actos). Possible side effects include:\n\nRisk of congestive heart failure.\nRisk of bladder cancer (pioglitazone).\nRisk of bone fractures.\nWeight gain.\n\nDPP-4 inhibitors help reduce blood sugar levels but tend to have a very modest effect. Examples include sitagliptin (Januvia), saxagliptin (Onglyza) and linagliptin (Tradjenta). Possible side effects include:\n\nRisk of pancreatitis.\nJoint pain.\n\nGLP-1 receptor agonists are injectable medications that slow digestion and help lower blood sugar levels. Their use is often associated with weight loss, and some may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. Examples include exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon Bcise), liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza) and semaglutide (Rybelsus, Ozempic, Wegovy). Possible side effects include:\n\nRisk of pancreatitis.\nNausea.\nVomiting.\nDiarrhea.\n\nSGLT2 inhibitors affect the blood-filtering functions in the kidneys by blocking the return of glucose to the bloodstream. As a result, glucose is removed in the urine. These medicines may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with a high risk of those conditions. Examples include canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga) and empagliflozin (Jardiance). Possible side effects include:\n\nVaginal yeast infections.\nUrinary tract infections.\nLow blood pressure.\nHigh cholesterol.\nRisk of gangrene.\nRisk of bone fractures (canagliflozin).\nRisk of amputation (canagliflozin).\n\nOther medicines your health care provider might prescribe in addition to diabetes medications include blood pressure and cholesterol-lowering medicines, as well as low-dose aspirin, to help prevent heart and blood vessel disease.\nInsulin therapy\nSome people who have type 2 diabetes need insulin therapy. In the past, insulin therapy was used as a last resort, but today it may be prescribed sooner if blood sugar targets aren't met with lifestyle changes and other medicines.\nDifferent types of insulin vary on how quickly they begin to work and how long they have an effect. Long-acting insulin, for example, is designed to work overnight or throughout the day to keep blood sugar levels stable. Short-acting insulin generally is used at mealtime.\nYour health care provider will determine what type of insulin is right for you and when you should take it. Your insulin type, dosage and schedule may change depending on how stable your blood sugar levels are. Most types of insulin are taken by injection.\nSide effects of insulin include the risk of low blood sugar \u2014 a condition called hypoglycemia \u2014 diabetic ketoacidosis and high triglycerides.\nWeight-loss surgery\nWeight-loss surgery changes the shape and function of the digestive system. This surgery may help you lose weight and manage type 2 diabetes and other conditions related to obesity. There are several surgical procedures. All of them help people lose weight by limiting how much food they can eat. Some procedures also limit the amount of nutrients the body can absorb.\nWeight-loss surgery is only one part of an overall treatment plan. Treatment also includes diet and nutritional supplement guidelines, exercise and mental health care.\nGenerally, weight-loss surgery may be an option for adults living with type 2 diabetes who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher. BMI is a formula that uses weight and height to estimate body fat. Depending on the severity of diabetes or the presence of other medical conditions, surgery may be an option for someone with a BMI lower than 35.\nWeight-loss surgery requires a lifelong commitment to lifestyle changes. Long-term side effects may include nutritional deficiencies and osteoporosis.\nPregnancy\nPeople living with type 2 diabetes often need to change their treatment plan during pregnancy and follow a diet that controls carbohydrates. Many people need insulin therapy during pregnancy. They also may need to stop other treatments, such as blood pressure medicines.\nThere is an increased risk during pregnancy of developing a condition that affects the eyes called diabetic retinopathy. In some cases, this condition may get worse during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, visit an ophthalmologist during each trimester of your pregnancy and one year after you give birth. Or as often as your health care provider suggests.\nSigns of trouble\nRegularly monitoring your blood sugar levels is important to avoid severe complications. Also, be aware of symptoms that may suggest irregular blood sugar levels and the need for immediate care:\nHigh blood sugar. This condition also is called hyperglycemia. Eating certain foods or too much food, being sick, or not taking medications at the right time can cause high blood sugar. Symptoms include:\n\nFrequent urination.\nIncreased thirst.\nDry mouth.\nBlurred vision.\nFatigue.\nHeadache.\n\nHyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS). This life-threatening condition includes a blood sugar reading higher than 600 mg/dL (33.3 mmol/L). HHNS may be more likely if you have an infection, are not taking medicines as prescribed, or take certain steroids or drugs that cause frequent urination. Symptoms include:\n\nDry mouth.\nExtreme thirst.\nDrowsiness.\nConfusion.\nDark urine.\nSeizures.\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs when a lack of insulin results in the body breaking down fat for fuel rather than sugar. This results in a buildup of acids called ketones in the bloodstream. Triggers of diabetic ketoacidosis include certain illnesses, pregnancy, trauma and medicines \u2014 including the diabetes medicines called SGLT2 inhibitors.\nThe toxicity of the acids made by diabetic ketoacidosis can be life-threatening. In addition to the symptoms of hyperglycemia, such as frequent urination and increased thirst, ketoacidosis may cause:\n\nNausea.\nVomiting.\nAbdominal pain.\nShortness of breath.\nFruity-smelling breath.\n\nLow blood sugar. If your blood sugar level drops below your target range, it's known as low blood sugar. This condition also is called hypoglycemia. Your blood sugar level can drop for many reasons, including skipping a meal, unintentionally taking more medication than usual or being more physically active than usual. Symptoms include:\n\nSweating.\nShakiness.\nWeakness.\nHunger.\nIrritability.\nDizziness.\nHeadache.\nBlurred vision.\nHeart palpitations.\nSlurred speech.\nDrowsiness.\nConfusion.\n\nIf you have symptoms of low blood sugar, drink or eat something that will quickly raise your blood sugar level. Examples include fruit juice, glucose tablets, hard candy or another source of sugar. Retest your blood in 15 minutes. If levels are not at your target, eat or drink another source of sugar. Eat a meal after your blood sugar level returns to normal.\nIf you lose consciousness, you need to be given an emergency injection of glucagon, a hormone that stimulates the release of sugar into the blood."}, "GERD": {"overview": "\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    How heartburn and GERD occur\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nHow heartburn and GERD occur\n\n\nHow heartburn and GERD occur\nAcid reflux occurs when the sphincter muscle at the lower end of your esophagus relaxes at the wrong time, allowing stomach acid to back up into your esophagus.

A tiny camera on the end of the endoscope allows views of your esophagus, stomach and the beginning of your small intestine, called the duodenum.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour health care provider might be able to diagnose GERD based on a history of your signs and symptoms and a physical examination.\nTo confirm a diagnosis of GERD, or to check for complications, your doctor might recommend:\n\n\nUpper endoscopy. Your doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube equipped with a light and camera (endoscope) down your throat. The endoscope helps your provider see inside your esophagus and stomach. Test results may not show problems when reflux is present, but an endoscopy may detect inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) or other complications.\nAn endoscopy can also be used to collect a sample of tissue (biopsy) to be tested for complications such as Barrett esophagus. In some instances, if a narrowing is seen in the esophagus, it can be stretched or dilated during this procedure. This is done to improve trouble swallowing (dysphagia).\n\n\nAmbulatory acid (pH) probe test. A monitor is placed in your esophagus to identify when, and for how long, stomach acid regurgitates there. The monitor connects to a small computer that you wear around your waist or with a strap over your shoulder.\nThe monitor might be a thin, flexible tube (catheter) that's threaded through your nose into your esophagus. Or it might be a clip that's placed in your esophagus during an endoscopy. The clip passes into your stool after about two days.\n\n\nX-ray of the upper digestive system. X-rays are taken after you drink a chalky liquid that coats and fills the inside lining of your digestive tract. The coating allows your doctor to see a silhouette of your esophagus and stomach. This is particularly useful for people who are having trouble swallowing.\nYou may also be asked to swallow a barium pill that can help diagnose a narrowing of the esophagus that may interfere with swallowing.\n\nEsophageal manometry. This test measures the rhythmic muscle contractions in your esophagus when you swallow. Esophageal manometry also measures the coordination and force exerted by the muscles of your esophagus. This is typically done in people who have trouble swallowing.\nTransnasal esophagoscopy. This test is done to look for any damage in your esophagus.

An infected nail may separate from the nail bed.\n\n\n\n\n Nail fungus is a common infection of the nail. It begins as a white or yellow-brown spot under the tip of your fingernail or toenail. As the fungal infection goes deeper, the nail may discolor, thicken and crumble at the edge. Nail fungus can affect several nails. If your condition is mild and not bothering you, you may not need treatment. If your nail fungus is painful and has caused thickened nails, self-care steps and medications may help. But even if treatment is successful, nail fungus often comes back. Nail fungus is also called onychomycosis (on-ih-koh-my-KOH-sis).

But you won't see the end result of treatment until the nail grows back completely. It may take four months or longer to eliminate an infection. Treatment success rates with these drugs appear to be lower in adults over age 65.\nOral antifungal drugs may cause side effects such as rash and liver damage.
